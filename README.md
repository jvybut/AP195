To fully explore this project, you can access the resources available in the provided GitHub repository: https://github.com/jvybut/AP195.git. The repository contains all the essential files and tools to understand and visualize the dynamics of a Hopfield network in action. The contents of the repository include:

**Digit Patterns Folder:** This folder includes the digit patterns used to train the Hopfield network. These patterns serve as the "stored memories" in the network, such as digit images (0, 1, etc.). The network will use these patterns for comparison as it attempts to retrieve a specific pattern from noisy inputs. Having access to these patterns is crucial for evaluating the network’s pattern recognition capability.

**PyCXSimulator Package:** This package provides a dynamic, interactive simulation environment where you can visualize the state changes of the Hopfield network. PyCX is particularly useful for observing the evolution of the network’s state over time as it converges toward a stored pattern or reaches a stable state. The PyCX simulator allows us to observe how noise is gradually reduced and how the network stabilizes.

**Google Collaboratory Notebook:** The Colab Notebook is provided was used for the analysis of the experiment with the Hopfield network model. The notebook contains code for training the network, adding noise to input patterns, and evaluating the network's performance. It also includes visualizations such as plots of the energy and error metrics over iterations, making it easy to track how the network evolves and recall accuracy as it learns patterns.

**Main Python File for Dynamic Visualization:** This main Python script is designed to dynamically visualize the states of the network over time. It allows you to observe the process of pattern retrieval in real time, showing the network’s response to various levels of noise in the input patterns. By running this script, you can see how the network transitions from a noisy input to a stable, recalled pattern (or fails to do so if the noise is too high).
